A mold is an idempotent function that coerces a [noun](/docs/glossary/noun/) to
be of a specific type or crashes.

The simplest molds to understand are arms of cores created with `+$`

```hoon
+$  height  [feet=@ud inches=@ud]
```

A mold is compiled to a gate that takes in any noun and produces a typed value, or crashes:

```hoon
(height [5 11])
::  produces [feet=5 inches=11]
```

```
(height %wrong)
::  crashes
```

To coerce using a gate, it's good practice to use the `;;` rune, which can parse inline molds.

```hoon
;;(height [5 11])
::  produces [feet=5 inches=11]
```

```hoon
;;([feet=@ud inches=@ud] [5 11])
::  produces [feet=5 inches=11]
```

`|$` is the mold builder rune which takes a list of molds and produces a mold.

`|$` implements [parametric
polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism) in Hoon,
and as such we call gates produced with `|$` a **wet gate**. We discuss what this
means in further detail in the upcoming lesson on [polymorphism](@/docs/hoon/hoon-school/type-polymorphism.md).

Let's look at some examples from `hoon.hoon`.

```hoon
++  pair
  |$  [head tail]
  [p=head q=tail]
```

Here is a very simple mold builder. It takes two molds and produces a mold that is a pair of those with the faces `p` and `q`. An example of using this would be `(pair @ud @ud)` which would produce a mold for a cell of `@ud` and `@ud`.

```hoon
++  each
  |$  [this that]
  $%  [%| p=that]
      [%& p=this]
  ==
```

`each` is very slightly more complicated than `pair`. `$%` is a rune that is a tagged union. The mold produced by this will match either `this` or `that`. An example of this would be `(each @ud @tas)` which will match either an `@ud` or a `@tas`.

```hoon
++  list
  |$  [item]
  $@(~ [i=item t=(list item)])
```

Here is a mold builder you've used previously. `$@` is a rune that will match the first thing if its sample is an [atom](/docs/glossary/atom/) and the second if the sample is a cell. You should be familiar at this point that a `list` is either `~` or a pair of an item and a list of item.

```hoon
++  lest
  |$  [item]
  [i/item t/(list item)]
```

`lest` you may have heard of as a "non empty list." You can see that it lacks the `~` case that `list` has but it matches the second part of the `list` definition. Remember that Hoon types are defined by shape. `list` could also have been defined in terms of `lest` like this:

```hoon
++  list
  |$  [item]
  $@(~ lest)
```

Another possible way to write it could have been

```hoon
++  list
  |$  [item]
  $@(~ [i=item t=$])
```

Any of these would be equivalent.
