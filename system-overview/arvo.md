Arvo is a purely functional,
[non-preemptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking) OS,
written in Hoon, that serves as the event manager of your urbit. It can upgrade
itself from over the network without downtime. The Arvo kernel proper is quite
simple -- it's only about 600 lines of code, excluding its various modules.

The Urbit transition function is implemented in Arvo. Upon being 'poked' by Vere
with the pair of `<input event, state>`, Arvo directs the event to the
appropriate OS module. The result of each Vere 'poke' is a pair of `<output
events, new state>`. Events are typed, and each has an explicit call-stack
structure indicating the event's source module in Arvo.

For a more in-depth technical introduction, see [Arvo Overview](@/docs/arvo/overview.md).

Arvo modules are also called 'vanes'.  Arvo's vanes are:

- [Ames](@/docs/arvo/ames/ames.md): defines and implements Urbit's encrypted P2P network protocol, as well
  as Urbit's identity protocol.
- [Behn](@/docs/arvo/behn/behn.md): manages timer events for other vanes.
- [Clay](@/docs/arvo/clay/clay.md): global, version-controlled, and referentially-transparent file system.
  Also includes our typed functional build system.
- [Dill](@/docs/arvo/dill/dill.md): terminal driver.
- [Eyre](@/docs/arvo/eyre/eyre.md): HTTP server.
- [Gall](@/docs/userspace/gall/gall.md): application sandbox and manager.
- [Iris](@/docs/arvo/iris/iris-api.md): HTTP client.
- [Jael](@/docs/arvo/jael/jael.md): Public and private key storage.
