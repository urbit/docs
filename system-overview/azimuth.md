Azimuth is a general-purpose public-key infrastructure (PKI) on the Ethereum
blockchain, used as a decentralized ledger for what are known as **Urbit
identities**, or simply **identities**. Having an identity is necessary to use
the Urbit network, which makes it important to have a neutral ledger to
determine who owns what.

Azimuth is not, however, part of the Urbit stack. Azimuth is a parallel system
that can be used as a generalized identity system for other projects. Azimuth
"touches" the Urbit ecosystem when an Urbit identity is used to boot a virtual
computer on the Arvo network for the first time. When that happens, the identity
considered **linked** to Azimuth and the identity's full powers are available
for use. Once an identity is linked, it cannot be unlinked.

A metaphor might make the relationship between these two systems to understand:
Azimuth is the bank vault that stores the deed to your house. The Urbit network
is the neighborhood that you live in.
