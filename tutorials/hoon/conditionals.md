In this lesson, we will write a generator that takes an integer and checks if it is an even number between 1 and 100. This will help demonstrate how boolean (true or false) conditional expressions work in Hoon.

```hoon
:-  %say
|=  [* [n=@ud ~] ~]
:-  %noun
^-  ?
?&  (gte n 1)
    (lte n 100)
    =(0 (mod n 2))
==
```

On the very first line, with `:-  %say` we are beginning to create a generator of the `%say` variety. The result of a `%say` generator is a cell with a head of `%say` and tail that is a [gate](/docs/glossary/gate/), itself producing a `cask`, a pair of a `mark` and some data. It's not important for understanding conditionals; this is just template code. For more information about `%say` generators, see the [Generators](@/docs/tutorials/hoon/generators.md) documentation.

```hoon
|=  [* [n=@ud ~] ~]
```

The code above builds a gate. The gate's first argument is a cell provided by Dojo that contains some system information we're not going to use, so we use `*` to indicate "any [noun](/docs/glossary/noun/)." The next cell is our arguments provided to the generator upon invocation at the `dojo`. Here we only want one `@ud` with the face `n`.

```hoon
:-  %noun
```

This code is the third line of the `%say` "boilerplate," and it produces a `cask` with the head of `%noun`. We could use any `mark` here, but `%noun` is the most generic type, able to fit any data.

```hoon
^-  ?
```
This line casts the output as a `flag`, which is a type whose values are `%.y` and `%.n` representing "yes" and "no". These behave as boolean values.

Let's look at the conditional.

```hoon
?&  (gte n 1)
```

`?&` (pronounced "wut-pam") takes in a list of Hoon expressions, terminated by `==`, that evaluate to a `flag` and returns the logical "AND" of these `flag`s. Most runes take a fixed number of children, but the handful that do not (such as `?&`) end their list of children with a terminating rune. In our context, that means that if the product of each of the children of `?&` is `%.y`, then the product of the entire `?&` expression is `%.y` as well. Otherwise, the product of the conditional `?&` is `%.n`.

The first child of `?&` is `(gte n 1)`. It is good practice to put the first boolean test of a conditional on the same line as the conditional as we have done here. This utilizes the standard library function `gte` which stands for "greater than or equal to". `(gte a b)` returns `%.y` if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `%.n` otherwise.

Next we have:
```hoon
    (lte n 100)
```
`lte` is the standard library function for "less than or equal to". `(lte a b)` returns `%.y` if `a` is less than `b`, and `%.n` otherwise.

The last boolean test we have is
```hoon
    =(0 (mod n 2))
```
This checks to see if `0` is equal to `(mod n 2)` - in other words, checking if `n` is even. It produces `%.y` if `n` is even and `%.n` if `n` is odd.

It is good practice in Hoon to put "lighter" lines at the top and "heavier" lines at the bottom, which is why we have put `=(0 (mod n 2))` last in the list of conditionals.

Finally we have a terminator.
```hoon
==
```
This marks the end of the list of children of `?&`.

### Other Runes

We only utilized one "wut" rune in our walkthrough, but there are many others. Here are a few more examples:

- `?:` (pronounced "wut-pam") is the simplest "wut" rune. It takes three children, also called sub-expressions. The first child is a boolean test, so it looks for a `%.y` or a `%.n`. The second child is a yes-branch, which is what we arrive at if the aforementioned boolean test evaluates to `%.y`. The third child is a no-branch, which we arrive at if the boolean test evaluates to `%.n`. These branches can contain any sort of Hoon expression, including further conditional expressions. Instead of the `?&` expression in our `%say` generator above, we could have written

```hoon
?:  ?&  (gte n 1)
        (lte n 100)
        =(0 (mod n 2))
    ==
    %.y
%.n
```
Of course, doing so would be needlessly obfuscating - we mention this only to illustrate that these two Hoon expressions have the same product.

- `?!` ("wut-zup") is the logical "NOT" operator, which inverts the truth value of its single child. Instead of `(lte n 100)` in our `%say` generator above, we could have written `?!  (gth n 100)`. Again, this would be bad practice, we only present this as an example.

- `?@` takes three children. It branches on whether its first child is an [atom](/docs/glossary/atom/).

- `?^` takes three children. It branches on whether its first child is a cell.

- `?~` takes three children. It branches on whether its first child is null.

- `?|` takes an indefinite number of children. It's the logical "or" operator. It checks if at least one of its children is true.
