Welcome to the documentation for the Urbit project. This documentation is maintained by [Tlon](https://tlon.io) in a public [Github repository](https://github.com/urbit/docs). Issues and contributions are welcome.

### [Glossary](@/docs/glossary/_index.md)

We recommend getting started with the Glossary, which explains Urbit concepts in an accessible, wiki-like format. Glossary pages will point you in the direction of more substantial documentation in other sections like Tutorials and Reference, so browsing it will help you discover the rest of the docs. Also note the search box, which is a handy way to look a term up.
