# Getting started

On disk your urbit is an append-only log and a checkpoint.  Or, in simpler terms, a directory where we keep your urbit’s state.  We call this a ‘pier’.

## Initialize

To create an urbit, we need an identity. This identity
is both a network address and a memorable name.

You are probably creating one of two kinds of urbit: a 32-bit
"planet" or a 128-bit "comet." For a quick terminology guide
and high-level refresher, refer to this [handy reference
sheet](/docs/about/glossary).

If you have an Urbit invitation, you'll have a planet like
`~fintud-macrep` and `~fortyv-tombyt-tabsen-sonres`.  To create
your pier:

    $ bin/urbit -w fintud-macrep -t fortyv-tombyt-tabsen-sonres

This will create a directory `fintud-macrep/` and begin building
your urbit. This may take a few minutes.

If you do not have a ticket, you can still make a 'comet', a wild
urbit drifting through cyberspace.  Pick your own directory name,
it doesn't matter:

    $ bin/urbit -c mycomet

This will create the directory `mycomet/` and generate a 128-bit identity for your urbit.

## Orientation

When your urbit is finished booting you should see a `dojo>` prompt.  Welcome!  

By default your urbit is quite bare-bones.  Let's stroll through what's already running:

### Shell — `:dojo`

The command prompt in front of you is a simple shell and Hoon REPL.  Let's make sure it works:

    ~fitund-macrep:dojo> (add 2 2)

Should produce:

    > (add 2 2)
    4

Good.

### Messaging — `:talk`

Use `^X` (ctrl-x) to change your prompt.  Let's join the main Urbit chat channel:

    ~fitund-macrep:talk() ;join ~doznec/urbit-meta

`:talk` is stateful, so your urbit will download a backlog.
`/urbit-meta` is the place to ask questions, get help and talk
about anything Urbit-related.

### Web — `:tree`

Urbit is also accessible through the web.  Try opening:

    http://localhost:8080/

in your favorite browser.  You'll be prompted to use `+code`.
This page was generated by `:tree`, the basic Urbit web
interface.  You can also access your urbit through
`http://fintud-macrep.urbit.org` (where `fintud-macrep` is your
planet name).  

### Filesystem — `%clay`

`%clay`, the Urbit filesystem, isn't mounted to unix by default.  Switch to the `:dojo` prompt and run:

    ~fitund-macrep:dojo> |mount %

This should produce:

    > |mount %
    >=

which indicates the command was processed.

`|mount %` will cause a `home/` directory to appear inside your pier folder.  Changes to these files are automatically synced into your urbit.
