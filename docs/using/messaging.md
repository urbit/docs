# Messaging (`:talk`)

<div class="row">

<div class="col-md-8">

`:talk` is the Urbit messaging and notifications protocol. Today we use
`:talk` just to chat and coordinate, but it's really a general purpose
piece of infrastructure.

For the time being come join us in `/urbit-meta` by using the
<a href="#-quickstart">quickstart</a> below.

Today `:talk` is sort of like a distributed, encrypted Slack that can be
used from the CLI and the browser. There’s no central `:talk` server.
Any Urbit can host one.

`:talk` is a general purpose tool for both aggregating and publishing
streams of messages. Applications can use `:talk` as their transport
protcol, API connectors can push disparate data sources into `:talk`,
and so on. There are lots of things a distributed message protocol can
be used for that we haven't even thought of.

## Quickstart

For the most part we use `:talk` as a single-instance of Slack: one main
channel (`/urbit-meta`) and dms. Everyone is more than welcome in
`/urbit-meta`. It's the place to get help, ask questions and chat about
Urbit in general.

Let's join `/urbit-meta`:

Use `ctrl-x` to switch from `:dojo` to `:talk`.

If you're a planet:

    ~your-urbit:talk> ;join /urbit-meta

If you're a comet:

    ~your-really-long-urbit:talk> ;join ~binzod/urbit-meta

You'll see:

    ---------:talk| %porch subscribed to /urbit-meta, called `>`
    ---------:talk| rules of /urbit-meta:
    ---------:talk|   don't be rude
    ---------:talk|   urbit-meta is politically correct and safe for work
           ~binzod= ~your-urbit admitted to %urbit-meta
    ~your-urbit:talk>

Post a line to `/urbit-meta`:

    ~your-urbit:talk> hello, world

You'll see, echoed back at you through `~binzod`:

    ~your-urbit> hello, world

To send a direct message to someone, first set your audience:

    ~your-urbit:talk> ;~talsur-todres

You'll see your prompt change:

    ~your-urbit:talk[~talsur-todres]

Now you and `~talsur-todres` can exchange messages directly.

To set your audience back to `/urbit-meta`:

    ~your-urbit:talk> ;~binzod/urbit-meta

Use `;leave` to unsubscribe from a channel:

    ~your-urbit:talk> ;leave ~binzod/urbit-meta

There are two ways of using `:talk`: from the CLI or through a web ui
available at `http://your-urbit.urbit.org/talk` (or
`http://localhost:8080/talk`).

The web ui ships as compiled JavaScript on your Urbit, but has its own
source repo [here](https://github.com/urbit/talk).

Last, let's create a channel we can invite some friends to:

    ~your-urbit:talk> ;create channel %my-channel 'some description'

Now you can tell your friends to `;join ~your-urbit/my-channel`.

## Manual

`:talk`'s design is similar in spirit to
[nntp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol),
the underlying protocol for Usenet.

Our design is pretty simple: `:talk` messages are called ‘posts’. Posts
go to ‘stations’. Any urbit can host or subscribe to any number of
stations.

There are four kinds of station: a write-only `%mailbox` for direct
messages, an invite-only `%party` for private conversation, a read-only
`%journal` for curated content, and a public-access `%channel` for
general use.

### Posts

For the time being a post is either a line, a URL or a command.

#### Lines

A line is 64 bytes of ASCII lowercase, spaces and punctuation. If the
line starts with '@', it's an action (IRC `/me`).

The `:talk` interface will let you keep typing past 64 bytes, but insert
a Unicode bullet-point character in an appropriate space in your post,
to show you the prospective linebreak. Your essay will be posted in
multiple lines.

    ~your-urbit:talk> this is a long message, so it will by truncated right at this•spot

will print as

    ~your-urbit; this is a long message, so it will by truncated right at this
    ~your-urbit; spot

#### URLs

A URL is any valid URL.

    ~your-urbit:talk> http://example.com

### Commands

A command is a hoon expression, prefaced by '\#'.

    ~your-urbit:talk> #(add 2 2)

### Activating Lines

A line number identifying the *subsequent* line is displayed every 5
lines.

    ---------[0]
    ~your-urbit; this is my message
    ~your-urbit@ this is an @ message
    ~your-urbit; this is a long message, so it will by truncated right at this
    ~your-urbit; spot
    ~your-urbit/ http://example.com/
    ---------[5]
    ~your-urbit# (add 2 2)  4

You can use a line number to *activate* a line:

    ~your-urbit:talk> ;0

which prints the number, line identifier, timestamp, sender, audience,
and contents:

    ? 0
      0v3.hl51p.jhege.amhec.vb37r.3rejr at ~2016.6.24..04.48.21..a235
      ~your-urbit to ~another-urbit
    this is my message

Activating a URL will print the full URL (it could have been truncated),
and activating a command will evaluate it.

You can activate the most recent line with `;`, the second-most recent
with `;;`, and so on.

### Creating and managing stations

`;create journal %serious-journal 'description'` - Creates a `%journal`,
a privately writable publicly readable station.

`;create channel %serious-channel 'description'` - Creates a `%channel`,
a publicly readable publicly writeable station.

### Presence

You'll see presence notifications when people enter or leave stations
you're subscribed to.

`;set quiet` - Turn off presence notifications

`;unset quiet` - Turn on presence notifications

`;who` - list everyone in all your stations

### Station Glyphs

Glyphs are assigned by station hash out of the following list

    > = + - } ) , . " ' ^ $ % & @

Alphanumeric characters and `|#;:*~_` are reserved; all others (the
above lists, and `\/!?({<`) can be manually assigned.

`;bind > /urbit-test` - assigns the `>` glyph to `/urbit-test`.

### Prefixes

Received posts are prefixed with a glyph to let you know what the
audience is. You can activate an individual post to see the full
audience.

`|` - Informational messages

`:` - Posts directly to you

`;` - Posts to you and others (a multiparty conversation)

`*` - Posts to a complex audience that doesn't directly include you.

### Audience

#### Prompt

The audience you're sending to is always shown in your prompt. If
there's a glyph for it, it's shown as the glyph.

Here we're talking to the station bound to `=`:

    ~your-urbit:talk=

Here we're talking directly to `~dannum-mitryl`:

    ~your-urbit:talk(~dannum-mitryl)

#### Configuration

`;~urbit/station` - Set audience to `~urbit/station`

`;=` - Set audience to the station bound to the `=` glyph

`;~dannum-mitryl` - Set audience to `~dannum-mitryl` (a direct post).

`;%station` - Set audience to a station on your own ship

`;~dannum-mitryl this is a private message` - Set the audience and send
a post in the same line. This works for all of the above.

Your audience is configured 'implicitly' with regard to the following
rules (in order):

-   if you manually locked the audience, that audience.
-   if typing a post, the audience when you started typing.
-   if you activated a post, the post you activated.
-   audience of the last post received.
-   audience of the last post sent.

Clear any 'implicit' audience setting by moving your cursor to the start
of the line and pressing backspace (whether the line is empty or not).
Posting a line clears the typing and activation configurations.

### Nicknames

`;nick` - list all nicknames

`;nick ~your-urbit` - look up a nickname

`;nick plato` - search in reverse

`;nick ~your-urbit plato` create a nickname

`;nick ~your-urbit ~` clear an assigned nickname

`;set noob` show nicknames instead of urbit names

`;unset noob` show urbit names instead of nicknames

All nicknames must be 14 characters or less, lowercase. Nicknames are
strictly local - like the names on entries in a phonebook. Sometimes in
a post you want to mention someone you know by a nickname. Just type
`~plato`, and `:talk` will replace it with `~your-urbit`.
