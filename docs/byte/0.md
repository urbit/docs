# Urbyte 0: Setup and nouns

This is the first post in our new Urbyte series.

The Urbyte concept is that you, an ordinary programmer, not a
kernel hacker or a Haskell magician (not that there's anything
wrong with kernel hackers or Haskell magicians) can learn Hoon,
Urbit's programming language.

We're going to test this daring idea by teaching you Hoon, in
easily digestible, byte-size chunks.  Each post in the "Urbytes"
series is designed to take about 15 minutes to consume.  (Maybe
10, if you're a kernel hacker or a Haskell magician.)

We'll assume no knowledge of Urbit except for previous lessons.
Ideally you have some basic familiarity with programming and can
operate the Unix command line.

We strongly encourage you to type in all the examples in each
Urbyte.  Urbytes are short, but not meant to be skimmed.

## Install

First, [install Urbit](http://urbit.org/docs/using/install/) on any
Mac or Unix machine.  On Windows, make a virtual Linux machine
using VirtualBox or a similar tool.

While you're downloading, read about Urbit ships:

## Ships

In the Urbyte exercises you'll be running what we call a "comet". A string starting with `~`, like `~zod`, is what Urbit
calls a *ship*.

A *ship* is one number which means four things: a network address,
a cryptographic identity, a memorable name, and a single virtual
computer.

We write this number in a base-256 format, where each digit is a
syllable.  Imagine if your phone number was a pronounceable
string which sounded like a name in a foreign language. `~zod`
is ship zero (making it a very important ship indeed!). An ordinary
user-level ship is a "planet", a 32-bit number which becomes
a four-syllable string, like `~talsur-todres`.

*Comets*, at 128-bits or 16 syllables, are
disposable identities that anyone can make for free to
join the live network. Thus, comets make the ideal ship for
playing around with Hoon, asking for help from other Urbit devs in [`:talk`](http://urbit.org/docs/using/messaging/) if you
need it, and showing off Urbit to your hacker friends.

## Create and restart

To create your comet, run:

```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir urbit
$ cd urbit
$ urbit -c mycomet
```

This will take a few minutes and will spin out a bunch of boot
messages. At the end, you'll see something like:

```
ames: on localhost, UDP 31337.
http: live (insecure, public) on 8080
http: live ("secure", public) on 8443
http: live (insecure, loopback) on 12321
~palnul_nocser:dojo>
```

To make sure everything is working, type `(add 2 2)` at the
prompt, then hit return.  Your screen now shows:

```
ames: on localhost, UDP 31337.
http: live (insecure, public) on 8080
http: live ("secure", public) on 8443
http: live (insecure, loopback) on 12321
> (add 2 2)
4
```
~palnul_nocser:dojo>

That's super awesome!  You made your first noun!  We'll make a
few more in a second.  First, quit Urbit with `ctrl-d`:

```
> (add 2 2)
4
~palnul_nocser:dojo>
$
```

You now have an Urbit image, or *pier*, in the `mycomet` directory.
Right now the only thing in your pier is Urbit's system files:

```
$ ls -a /path/to/mycomet
./  ../ .urb/
```

Restarting uses almost the same command, but without `-c` (which
means "create").  There are also fewer startup messages:

```
$ urbit mycomet
[...]
ames: on localhost, UDP 31337.
http: live (insecure, public) on 8080
http: live ("secure", public) on 8443
http: live (insecure, loopback) on 12321
~palnul_nocser:dojo>
```

Note also that Urbit is an ACID database.  You can stop it
politely with `ctrl-d`, abruptly with `ctrl-z`, even violently with `kill
-9`.  None of these should cause Urbit to lose data.  If you do
manage to corrupt a pier, it's a bug; please let us know.

## Let's make a noun

You've already made a noun.  Let's make another!

*We won't show the `~palnul_nocser:dojo> ` prompt from here on out.
We'll just show the echoed command.*


```
~palnul_nocser:dojo> 42
42
```

You'll see:

```
> 42
42
```

## Understanding nouns

A value in Urbit is called a *noun*.  A noun is either an *atom*
(an unsigned integer of any size) or a *cell* (an ordered pair of
any two nouns).

In a sentence, a noun is a binary tree whose leaves are numbers.
If you know Lisp, a noun is a minimalist S-expression.  A noun
can't have cycles (pointer loops).  An implementation can use
dags (shared subtrees), but the programmer can't detect them
(there's no pointer equality test).

The absence of graph cycles makes nouns much easier to save in
persistent storage, send over the network, manage memory for
(Urbit has no tracing garbage collector), etc.

## Let's make some atoms

So one kind of atom is a number.  And the syntax (or at least one
syntax) for a number is a decimal, like `42`.  Seems legit.

But just to be sure we understand this decimal thing, let's make
some atoms:

```
> 4
4
```

Seems pretty straightforward.

```
> 42
42
```

Why not try it again to make sure?

```
> 420
420
```

Can we add another zero?

```
> 420
```

Wat?  When you tried to type that next zero and turn `420` into
`4200`, Urbit actually *deleted the `0` and beeped at you.*

But isn't an atom an unsigned integer of any size?  It is.
But the syntax is actually `4.200`:

```
> 4.200
4.200
> (mul 42 100)
4.200
```

Just think of it as "4,200", written the German way with a dot.

Why?  Long decimals are unreadable.  Human beings know this, so
we group them in threes.  For some historical reason, programming
languages never copied this marvelous usability innovation.

English notation for decimals is more common than German
notation.  Unfortunately, dot is URL-safe and comma isn't, and
it's nice to have a regular syntax for atoms that's URL-safe.

As for why Urbit deleted your zero: it parses your command line
as you type, and rejects any characters after the parser stops.

## Let's make some cells

There's not much mystery about cells.  A cell has a head and a
tail, and puts brackets around them:

```
> [42 420]
[42 420]
```

`42` is the *head* and `420` is the *tail* of the cell.  Cell
syntax nests to the right:

```
> [4 [42 420]]
[4 42 420]

> [4 42 420]
[4 42 420]

> [[4 42] 420]
[[4 42] 420]
```

If you look at these nouns as binary trees, you see

```
 [4 [42 420]]       [[4 42] 420]
     .                  .
    / \                /  \
   4   .              .   420
      / \            / \
    42  420         4  42
```

Each number is an atom; each dot is a cell.

## And we're done

And we're done!  Type `|exit` to exit:

```
~palnul_nocser:dojo> |exit
%drum-exit
$
```

## Questions and/or exercises

And we're done with our very first Urbyte!  Here are some questions to
think about.  These exercises are never mandatory, but they may
be fun and/or interesting.  Skip them if they're obvious.

* What is the right way to represent common
data structures as nouns?
* A linked list?
* A string?  A *signed* integer?
* A table or associative array?

Just try to picture these structures in your head, or draw them on a piece of paper.
