# Urbit Glossary

Urbit is renowned for its exotic terminology. Here's a simple overview
from the strange words in.

As Dijkstra put it: "The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but
to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise."

## Ships

An Urbit *ship* is a cryptographic title on a *will* signed by private 
key, a human-memorable name, and a packet routing address. Ships are 
classed by the number of bits in their address:

    Size   Name    Parent  Object      Example
    -----  ------  ------  ------      -------
    2^8    galaxy  ~       supernode   ~zod
    2^16   star    galaxy  supernode   ~dozbud
    2^32   planet  star    user        ~tasfyn-partyv
    2^64   moon    planet  device      ~sigsam-nimbot-tasfyn-partyv
    2^128  comet   ~       bot         ~racmus-mollen-fallyt-linpex--watres-sibbur-modlux-rinmex

Any ship can be called an "urbit."

> A summary [here](http://urbit.org/posts/address-space/).

An Urbit identity is a string like `~firbyr-napbes`. It means nothing,
but it's easy to remember and say out loud. `~firbyr-napbes` is actually
just a 32-bit number, like an IP address, that we turn into a
human-memorable string.

Technically, an urbit is a secure digital identity that you own and
control with a cryptographic key, like a Bitcoin wallet. As in Bitcoin,
the supply of urbits is mathematically limited. This keeps the network
friendly, by making spam and abuse expensive.

An urbit name is just a number; smaller numbers make shorter names.
Shorter names are easier to remember, so they're more valuable. So
urbits are classified by the number of bits in their name. (A ship name
is just a scrambled base-256 representation of the number.)

A 32-bit urbit (like `~firbyr-napbes`) is called a *planet.* A 16-bit
urbit (like `~pollev)` is a *star.* An 8-bit ship (like `~mun`) is a
*galaxy.* A planet is an identity for an independent, adult human. Stars
and galaxies are network infrastructure.

Each planet or star is launched by its *parent,* the star or galaxy
whose number is its bottom half. So the planet `~firbyr-napbes`,
`0xdead.beef` or `3.735.928.559`, is the child of `~pollev`, `0xbeef` or
`48.879`, whose parent is `~mun`, `0xef`, `239`. The parent of `~mun`
and all galaxies is `~zod`, `0`.

### Nock

> Nock is a Turing-complete, non-lambda combinator interpreter.

-   *noun*: an *atom* or a *cell*
-   *atom*: any natural number
-   *cell*: any ordered pair of nouns
-   *subject*: a noun - the data against which a `formula` is
    evaluated
-   *formula*: a noun - a function at the Nock level
-   *product*: a noun - the result of evaluating a formula against a
    subject

*See [Nock definition](../../nock/definition/).*

### Hoon

> Hoon is a strict, higher-order typed functional language that compiles
> itself to Nock.

###### span: an inferred type

A *span* defines a set (finite or infinite) of nouns and ascribes some
semantics to it. There is no Hoon syntax for a span; it is always
produced as the inferred range of an expression (*twig*).

*See [basic types](../../hoon/basic/#-type-span-and-mold).*

###### core: a code-data cell

The code (*battery*) is the head, the data (*payload*) is the tail. All
code-data structures in normal languages (functions, objects, modules,
etc) become *core*s in Hoon.

-   *battery*: the code of a core, a tree of *arms*
-   *payload*: the data in a core

*See [basic types](../../hoon/basic)*.

###### arm: a named, functionally-computed attribute of a core

The *twig* of each arm is compiled to a Nock formula, with the
enclosing `core` itself as the subject.

There are two kinds of arms: *dry* and *wet*. Most arms are dry.

-   *dry*: normal, `++`, polymorphic by means of *variance*

For a dry arm, we ask, is the new payload compatible with the old
payload (against which the core was compiled)?

-   *wet*: unusual, `+-`, polymorphic by means of *genericity*

A wet arm uses the twig as a macro. We create a new type analysis
path, which works as if we expanded the callee with the caller's
context.

*See [advanced types](/hoon/advanced)*.

###### metal: a variance model

Every core has a *metal* which defines its variance model (ie, the
properties of the span of a compatible core). The default is `gold`
(invariant).

-   `gold`: *invariant*
-   `lead`: *bivariant*
-   `zinc`: *covariant*
-   `iron`: *contravariant*

*See [advanced types](/hoon/advanced)*.

###### gate: a function/lambda/closure

A *gate* is a core with one arm. To call a gate on an argument,
replace the sample (at [tree
address](../../hoon/twig/limb/limb/) `+6` in the core) with the
argument, and then compute the arm.

The payload of a gate has a shape of `{sample context}`.

-   *sample*: the argument tuple
-   *context*: the subject in which the gate was defined

*See [basic types](../../hoon/basic/#-core-p-span-q-map-term-span),
[`%-` or `:call`](../../hoon/twig/cen-call/hep-call/) (the `twig` for
calling a `gate`).*

###### mold: a type constructor / validator

A *mold* is an idempotent gate (function), accepting any noun, and
producing a range with a useful span.

-   *bunt*: the value a mold produces when normalizing its default
    sample
-   *icon*: the span of the mold's range

*See [mold twigs](/hoon/twig/buc-mold/).*

###### atom

A Hoon *atom* span describes a Nock atom, with two additional pieces
of metadata: an *aura*, and an optional constant.

An atom span is *warm* or *cold* based on whether the constant exists.

-   *warm*: if the constant is `~` (null), any atom is in the span
-   *cold*: if the constant is `[~ atom]`, its only legal value is
    `atom`.

*See [basic types](../../hoon/basic/#-atom-p-term-q-unit-atom)*

###### aura: a soft atom type

*aura* is a name for an atom type. It represents the structure of an
atom in a string beginning with `@`. An aura may represent units,
print format, or other semantics. Its constraints on the value of an
atom aren't enforced in any way.

Two auras are compatible if one is a prefix of the other. You can
change any aura into any other aura by casting through the empty
aura, `@`. The standard library has molds which alias many common
auras.

Some common auras and their aliases:

-   *term* (`@tas`): a symbol - an atomic ASCII string which obeys
    symbol rules: lowercase and digit only, infix hyphen ("kebab-case"),
    first character must be lowercase alphabetic.
-   *cord* (`@t`): UTF-8 text, least-significant-byte first
-   *char* (`@tD`): a character, a single unicode byte (for multi-byte
    characters and codepoints, see `@c`)

*See [basic types](../../hoon/basic/#-atom-p-term-q-unit-atom)*.

###### twig: a Hoon expression

A *twig* is a Hoon expression. Specifically, twig is the mold for the
noun that a Hoon source expression compiles to. A twig is always a cell.

A twig has one of two forms: `{twig twig}`, which produces the ordered
pair of the two twigs, or a cell `{stem bulb}`, where `stem` is an
atomic symbol.

-   *stem*: an atomic symbol (`@tas`) - the name of a twig.
-   *bulb*: The mold of the twig's contents.

Most twigs have a *regular form*, beginning with a *sigil* which is
either a *keyword* or a *rune*. Some twigs also have a syntactic
*irregular form*; a few have *only* an *irregular form*.

-   *sigil*: a *keyword* or *rune* used to begin a twig
-   *keyword*: the value of a stem, prefixed with `:`.
-   *rune*: a pair of ASCII symbols used to begin a twig.

For example, the stem `%if` becomes the keyword
[`:if`](../../hoon/twig/wut-test/col-if/), with the rune `?:`. The first
symbol in a rune represents a family of related `twig`s. For example,
the [`?` family](../../hoon/twig/wut-test/) are all conditionals.

The keyword or rune forms are up to the programmer's choice. Most
existing code uses runes, but the keyword form makes the learning path
easier.

A regular twig has two syntactic forms, *tall* and *flat*:

-   *tall*: multiple lines, no parentheses, two or more spaces between
    tokens
-   *flat*: one line, parentheses, one space between tokens

Tall twigs can contain flat ones, but not vice versa. All irregular
forms are flat.

*See [twig concept](../../hoon/concepts/#-twig-expression),
[expressions](../../hoon/twig/), and [syntax](../../hoon/syntax/)*.

###### limb: attribute or variable reference

To resolve a *limb* named "foo", the subject is searched depth-first,
head-first for either a face named "foo" or a core with an arm of
"foo". If a face is found, the result is a leg, if a core is
found, the result is the product of the arm.

-   *leg*: a subexpression, or subtree of the subject.
-   *wing*: a list of limbs, searched from right to left (`a.b` means
    `b` within `a`).

*See [Limbs and wings](../../hoon/twig/limb)*

###### slot: a tree addressing scheme

Every cell has a head and a tail, each of which may be either an atom or
a cell. Therefore every noun is a binary tree. `+1` or `.` resolves to
the whole cell (technically this would work against an atom as well).
The head of `+n` is `+2n`, the tail is `+(2n+1)`. 

###### face: a labeled subtree

Hoon has no scope or symbol-table; there is only the subject. To
"declare" a "variable" is to construct a new subject:
`[name=value old-subject]`.

A *face* is a span that wraps a name (`@tas`) around another span.

*See [advanced types](../../hoon/advanced/#-face-aliases-and-bridges)*.

###### nest: type compatibility test

*nest* is an internal function on two spans, which produces yes if the
set of nouns in the second span is provably a subset of the first.

*See [advanced types](../../hoon/advanced/)*.

###### loobean: a Hoon boolean

`0` (`%.y`) is *yes*, `1` (`%.n`) is *no*.
