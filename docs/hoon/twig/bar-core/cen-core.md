# `:core  |%  "barcen"`

Form a core `{battery payload}` with subject as the payload.

## Produces

A core with battery `p`.  Payload is the subject.

## Syntax

Regular: *battery*.

## Discussion

A core is like an "object" in a conventional language, but its
attributes (*arms*) are functions on the core, not the core and
an argument.  A "method" on a core is an arm producing a gate.

## Examples

A trivial core:

```
~zod:dojo> =foo  =+  x  58
                 |%
                 ++  n  (add 42 x)
                 ++  g  |=  b/@
                        (add b n)
                 --
~zod:dojo> n.foo
100
~zod:dojo> (g.foo 1)
101
```
