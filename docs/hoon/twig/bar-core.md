# Core, `|` ("bar")

Core twigs are flow twigs.  The compiler essentially pins a Nock
formula, or battery of formulas, to the subject.

All `|` twigs are macros around `$core`.  (See the `$core`
section in [`span`](../span) above.)  `$core` uses the subject as
the payload of a battery, whose arms are compiled with the core
itself as the subject.
