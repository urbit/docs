# `:if  ?:  "wutcol"`

`{$if p/seed q/seed r/seed}`: branch on a boolean test.

## Produces

If `p` produces yes, then `q`. If `p` produces no, `r`.
If `p` is not a boolean, compiler yells at you.

The subjects of `q` and `r` are constrained to match any
pattern-matching algebra in `p`.  The analysis, which is
conservative, understands any combination of `:fits`
(`?=`), `:and` (`?&`), `:or` (`?|`), and `:not` (`?!`),
and reduces the subject appropriately when compiling.

If test analysis reveals that either branch is not taken,
or if `p` is not a boolean, compilation fails.  However,
an untaken branch can be indicated with the `:lost` twig.

## Syntax

Regular: *3-fixed*.

## Discussion

Short-circuiting in boolean tests works as you'd expect
and includes the expected inference.  For instance,
if you write `:and(a b)`, `b` is only executed if `a` is
positive, and compiled with that assumption.

Note also that all other branching twigs reduce to `:if`.

## Examples

```
~zod:dojo> :if((gth 1 2) 3 4)
4
```

```
~zod:dojo> ?:((gth 1 2) 3 4)
4
```
