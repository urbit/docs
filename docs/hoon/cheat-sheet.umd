We've found it's useful to have a quick reference of Hoon's syntax always at 
hand. So above is a download link to a Hoon cheatsheet .pdf. It's missing a 
few of the literal syntaxes, but it covers the most common ones. 

This doesn't list any of the Ford runes, although there is now at least 
some documentation for those [here](/docs/arvo/internals/ford/runes). 

The following runes also exist, but are currently undocumented and not listed in the cheat sheet:

```
!:  ::  turn on debugging printfs
!.  ::  turn off debugging printfs
!;  ::  using the "type of type", emit the type for an expression
!,  ::  emit AST of expression
$*  ::  bunt (irregular form is *)
^.  ::  use gate to transform type
^&  ::  zinc (covariant) -- see the docs on advanced types
```

Hope this helps!
