#  Math

1.  Write a function that produces a list of the first `n`
    triangular numbers.  The `n`th triangular number is the sum
    of the first `n` positive integers.

1.  Using the program from the previous exercise, write a
    function that produces the first `n` tetrahedral numbers.
    The `n`th tetrahedral number is the sum of the first `n`
    triangular numbers.

1.  The Fibonacci numbers are defined on the natural numbers as
    follows:

    ```
    fib(0) = 0
    fib(1) = 1
    fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
    ```

    Write a function that computes the `nth` Fibonacci number.
