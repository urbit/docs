# Friends of FizzBuzz

+ Consider the following implementation of FizzBuzz, which is
  equivalent to the one in the [Demo](../../demo) section.

  ```
  |=  end/atom
  =+  count=1
  |-
  ^-  (list tape)
  ?:  =(end count)
     ~
  :-
    ?:  =(0 (mod count 15))
      "FizzBuzz"
    ?:  =(0 (mod count 5))
      "Fizz"
    ?:  =(0 (mod count 3))
      "Buzz"
    (pave !>(count))
  $(count (add 1 count))
  ```

  Modify this to produce "Fuzz" when the number is divisible by
  7, "Fuzz" when divisible by 21, "FuzzFizz" when divisible by 35,
  and "FuzzFizzBuzz" when divisible by 105.

+ Modify FizzBuzz from the previous exercise to take both a
  start and an end number.

+ Modify FizzBuzz from the previous exercise to count down
  instead of up.
