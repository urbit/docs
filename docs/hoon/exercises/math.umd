# Math

+ Write a function that produces a list of the first `n`
  triangular numbers.  The `n`th triangular number is the sum
  of the first `n` positive integers.

+ Using the program from the previous exercise, write a
  function that produces the first `n` tetrahedral numbers.
  The `n`th tetrahedral number is the sum of the first `n`
  triangular numbers.

+ The Fibonacci numbers are defined on the natural numbers as
  follows:

  ```
  fib(0) = 0
  fib(1) = 1
  fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
  ```

  Write a function that computes the `nth` Fibonacci number.
