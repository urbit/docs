A **comet** is a kind of [ship](../ship) on the [Arvo](../arvo) network. They are disposable identities that will not be initially trusted by others on the network. One use might be to run bots as comets.

Comets have no presence on [Azimuth](../azimuth) and thus have no associated Urbit identities.
