**Sail** and **Udon** are domain specific languages for Hoon.

Sail is used to express XML data structures, which are used for rendering webpages, such as when browsing [collections](../collection) in [Landscape](../landscape).

Udon is similar to Markdown, a simple language for writing documents. Udon is stored in [Clay](../clay) and rendered using [Ford](../ford).
