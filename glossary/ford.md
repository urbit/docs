**Ford** is the build-system [vane](../vane). Ford is capable of sequencing generic asynchronous computations. Its uses include linking source files into programs, assembling live-updating websites, and performing file-type conversions.

Ford neither accepts Unix events nor produces Unix effects. It exists entirely for the benefit of [Arvo](../arvo) applications and other vanes, specifically [Clay](../clay) and [Gall](../gall).

Ford is located at `/home/sys/vane/ford.hoon` within [Arvo](../arvo).
