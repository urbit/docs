**Eyre** is the web-server [vane](../vane) that handles everything HTTP-related. Unix sends HTTP messages though to Eyre and Eyre produces HTTP messages in response.

In general, apps and vanes do not call Eyre; rather, Eyre calls apps and vanes. Eyre uses [Ford](../ford) and [Gall](../gall) to functionally publish pages and facilitate communication with apps.

Eyre is located at `/home/sys/vane/eyre.hoon` within [Arvo](../arvo).
