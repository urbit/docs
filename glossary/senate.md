The **Galactic Senate** is the body of all [galaxies](../galaxy) that governs [Azimuth](../azimuth) by [majority vote](../voting). There are two types of votes: a constitution vote, which is a motion to update the logic of Azimuth; and a [documentation vote](../docvote), which is a motion to legitimize or approve the content of an arbitrary document.
