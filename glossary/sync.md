**|sync** sets up a sychronization between two [Clay](../clay) [desks](../desk). It is mostly used to distribute kernel updates.

By default, in the [galaxy](../galaxy)/[star](../star)/[planet](../planet)/[moon](../moon) hierachy, the kids desk of the parent is synchronized with the base desk of the child.
