Hoon is a strict, higher-order typed functional programming language that compiles itself to [Nock](../nock). As a result Hoon code is effectively implemented by the interpreter [Vere](../vere). Programs for the Urbit operating system and kernel, [Arvo](../arvo), are written in Hoon.

The Hoon source file is located in `/home/sys/hoon.hoon` within your Urbit.
