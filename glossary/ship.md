A **ship** is an instance of an Urbit computer that is a peer on the [Arvo](../arvo) network.

A ship can be one of five classes:

- [comets](../comet), disposable identities.
- [moons](../moon), connected devices subordinated to a ship.
- [planets](../planet), individual users.
- [stars](../star), network infrastructure nodes.
- [galaxy](../galaxy), also network infrastructure nodes.

To be able to use the Arvo network, planets, stars, and galaxies must be combined with an [Azimuth](../azimuth)-based Urbit identity in the form of a [keyfile](../keyfile).
