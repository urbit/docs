**Jacque** is a new [Nock](../nock) interpreter under development that is intended to replace the current worker process for [Vere](../vere).

The current worker utilized by Vere is written in C, while Jacque is written using Java. The primary benefits of switching to Java are the ecosystem benefits and the fact that Java is more memory safe than C.
